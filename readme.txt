# This file is basically a short demo of the game Anchorhead, by Michael Gentry.
#   The text used is almost entirely taken from Anchorhead. The original game
#   was made using Inform v6.15 (Library 6/7), and my demo version was made in
#   Python 2.7. I created this file for Exercise 36 of Learn Python the Hard
#   Way, the goal of which is to make a game using the skills learned up to that
#   point of the book. I thought the exercise would be much more interesting if
#   I were to mimic a game I really enjoyed. For reference, the full game can be
#   found at http://pr-if.org/play/anchorhead/ (at least as of this writing).
